# Atom Walkthrough

Now that we have a basic understanding of atom, docker, and docker-compose we can go ahead and make a simple element!

Here's what we'll cover in this walkthrough.

- Setting up your project
- Creating a simple element
- Setting up your Dockerfile
- Modifying your launch script
- Launching the system with docker-compose
- Interacting and debugging with atom-cli

<aside class="notice">
This example is written in Python, please switch over to the `python` tab at right.

## Project Template

Download the files below and put them into a new folder named `atombot` on your system. These files are taken from the [template](https://github.com/elementary-robotics/atom/tree/latest/template) from the Atom OS repo. (Note your browser may add a .txt extension when you download Dockerfile below.  In that case remove the extension.)

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| <a href="/walkthrough/Dockerfile" download>`Dockerfile`</a> | Specifies how to build the element into a Docker container. Installs everything the element needs and copies the code. |
| <a href="/walkthrough/launch.sh" download>`launch.sh`</a> | Runs when the element is booted, invokes the proper commands/sequence to get the element up and running. |
| <a href="/walkthrough/docker-compose.yml" download>`docker-compose.yml`</a> | Specifies which elements to launch and how to link them. At the very least needs the `nucleus` element as well as our element! |

## Creating a simple element

```cpp

```

Download the `atombot.py` file <a href="/walkthrough/atombot.py" download>here</a>. The file is also shown at right for reference. This file implements the `AtomBot` element using the Python3 language client of the Atom OS. It exposes several commands as well as publishes some data.

## Setting up your Dockerfile

```
# Dockerfile

FROM elementaryrobotics/atom

# Want to copy over the contents of this repo to the code
#	section so that we have the source
ADD . /code

# Here, we'll build and install the code s.t. our launch script,
#	now located at /code/launch.sh, will launch our element/app

#
# TODO: build code
#

# Finally, specify the command we should run when the app is launched
WORKDIR /code
# If you had a requirements file you could uncomment the line below
# RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt
RUN chmod +x launch.sh
CMD ["/bin/bash", "launch.sh"]
```

Nothing to do in this case, as the default `Dockerfile` should work for us.
However, if you needed to install any Python dependencies through pip or run a Makefile, `Dockerfile` would have to be modified.


## Modifying your launch script

> <button class="copy-button" onclick='copyText(this, "# launch.sh\r\n#!\/bin\/bash\r\n\r\npython3 atombot.py\r\n")'>Copy</button> Launch Script

```shell
# launch.sh
#!/bin/bash

python3 atombot.py
```

Modify the launch script `launch.sh` by copying the content on the right, to run your atombot executable.
Your docker container will run any commands in this script upon launch.

## Launching the system with docker-compose

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml

version: "3.2"

services:

  nucleus:
    container_name: nucleus
    image: elementaryrobotics/nucleus
    volumes:
      - type: volume
        source: shared
        target: /shared
        volume:
          nocopy: true
    command: ./launch.sh

  my_element:
    container_name: my_element
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - type: volume
        source: shared
        target: /shared
        volume:
          nocopy: true
    depends_on:
      - "nucleus"
    command: tail -f /dev/null

volumes:
  shared:
    driver_opts:
      type: tmpfs
      device: tmpfs
```

> <button class="copy-button" onclick='copyText(this, "docker-compose build")'>Copy</button> Build element

```shell_session
$ docker-compose build
```

> <button class="copy-button" onclick='copyText(this, "docker-compose up -d")'>Copy</button> Start app

```shell_session
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Rename the `my_element` service and `container_name` to `atombot`, so that our docker container is appropriately named.

Remove the line that contains `tail -f /dev/null` in the `atombot` service.
This line is useful for development purposes as it keeps a container alive when the launch script is empty. However, since we have already modified the launch script, we no longer need this command.

<aside class="notice">If there are errors in your program that prevent it from running, the docker container will automatically shutdown. In this case, you may want to use the tail command as in the template's docker-compose file.</aside>

While in the `atombot` directory, run the following commands:

- Build the docker container for your element
    - `docker-compose build`
- Start the docker containers needed to run your element
    - `docker-compose up -d`

Congratulations! Your element is now running.

Now that our atombot element is running, let's interact with it using `atom-cli`.
`atom-cli` is a tool used for debugging elements that comes installed in every element's container.

- Find the name of your element's container
    - `docker container list`
    - You will see an `atombot` container if you successfully modified the `docker-compose` file.
- Launch `atom-cli` in the container
    - `docker exec -it <CONTAINER_NAME> atom-cli`

<aside class="notice">If you would like to use a bash shell to debug your element's container you can run bash instead of atom-cli.</aside>

- You can list all of the available commands in `atom-cli` using the `help` command.
- You can view the usage of any command by typing `help <COMMAND>`
- Let's see if our atombot element is running
    - `list elements`
    - You should see `atombot` listed
- Let's see what streams atombot has
    - `list streams atombot`
- Let's read from the `pos_map` stream
    - `read atombot pos_map`
    - Great! We can see that atombot is in the center of the map
    - The read command will continually read from any element's stream until the user press CTRL+C
- Let's move atombot to the left
    - `command atombot move_left 2`
- We can control the rate at which the messages are printed by passing in the rate value (hz)
    - `read atombot pos_map 1`
- By default, atom-cli automatically msgpacks the data that is sent/received
- If you wish, you can override this with the `serialization` command
    - `serialization none`
    - Now if you try `read atombot pos_map 1`, you should see the raw binary data sent to this stream.
    - Do `serialization msgpack` to re-enable msgpack serialization
    - Do `serialization arrow` to use Apache Arrow serialization
- We can see the history of our commands by using the `records` command
    - `records cmdres atombot`
- You can exit atom-cli by either
    - `exit`
    - CTRL+D
- Finally, you can shut down your element by running the following command on your host machine
    - `docker-compose down -t 0 -v`
